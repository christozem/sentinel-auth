# SentinelAuth

A simple web application built with Node.js and deployed on AWS.

This project intentionally starts with weak security so I can
demonstrate common web application vulnerabilities and how to fix them.

Features:
- User registration
- Login with JWT
- User profile endpoint

Security hardening will be added in later phases.
